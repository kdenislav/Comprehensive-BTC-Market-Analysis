# COMPREHENSIVE BTC MARKET ANALYSIS

### INTRODUCTION

Welcome!
This is my first project for my Data Analysis portfolio. I’ve finished Google Professional Data Analytics Certificate program and currently studying Google Advanced Data Analysis. I’m devoting myself to improve and practice Data Analysis by cleaning, processing, transforming, and analyzing more data from Kaggle or my courses. In this dataset, I will analyze the Bitcoin Historical Data, which has started from 2010, and up to 2024 using (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share) methodology, which had been the mainstay of Google Professional Data Analytics program.
